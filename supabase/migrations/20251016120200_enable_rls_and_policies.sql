-- Migration: Enable Row Level Security and create policies
-- Purpose: Secure all tables with RLS policies to ensure data isolation per user
-- Affected: All core tables receive RLS policies
-- Author: Database setup based on db-plan.md
-- Date: 2025-10-16
-- Security: All policies ensure users can only access their own data

-- =====================================================================
-- 1. Enable Row Level Security on All Tables
-- =====================================================================

-- Enable RLS for user profile data
alter table profiles enable row level security;

-- Enable RLS for user notes
alter table notes enable row level security;

-- Enable RLS for user entities (tags)
alter table entities enable row level security;

-- Enable RLS for note-entity relationships
alter table note_entities enable row level security;

-- Enable RLS for entity relationships (knowledge graph edges)
alter table relationships enable row level security;

-- Enable RLS for AI suggestions
alter table ai_suggestions enable row level security;

-- Enable RLS for AI error logs
-- Even though this is logging data, we protect it to ensure privacy
alter table ai_error_logs enable row level security;

  to authenticated
  using (
    exists (
      select 1 from notes
      where notes.id = note_entities.note_id
      and notes.user_id = (select auth.uid())
