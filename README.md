## Project Description

ClassicInsight is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) web application designed for literature and philosophy enthusiasts. Its primary goal is to facilitate the exploration, analysis, and comparison of philosophical works and literary classics. The application allows users to create and manage notes, which can then be enriched by artificial intelligence with related quotes, summaries, and key ideas. A key feature is the visualization of connections between notes and concepts in the form of an interactive mind map.

## Tech Stack

The project is built with a modern, component-based architecture. The main technologies used are:

- **Framework**: [Astro 5](https://astro.build/)
- **UI Library**: [React 19](https://react.dev/)
- **Language**: [TypeScript 5](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **UI Components**: [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- **Database**: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (as inferred from project structure guidelines)

## Getting Started Locally

To set up and run the project on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/marcinczerny/classic-insights.git
    cd classic-insights
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    The project requires a connection to a Supabase backend. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example structure below.

    ```env
    # .env

    # Public Supabase URL
    PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="your_supabase_project_url"

    # Public Supabase Anon Key
    PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your_supabase_anon_key"
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:4321`.

## Available Scripts

## Project Scope

This project is currently being developed as an MVP. The scope is defined as follows:

### Key Features (MVP)

-   **User Management**: Secure user registration, login, logout, and password reset.
-   **Note Management**: Create, read, update, and delete text-based notes with Markdown support.
-   **Entity Tagging**: Add entities (e.g., Author, Work, Idea) as tags to notes.
-   **AI Enrichment**: Manually trigger AI analysis on a note to get suggestions for related quotes, summaries, and new graph nodes.
-   **Mind Map Visualization**: View notes, entities, and their relationships as an interactive graph.
-   **Search**: Filter notes based on their assigned tags.

### Out of Scope for MVP

The following features are not planned for the initial release but may be considered in the future:

-   Social features like sharing notes or graphs.
-   Advanced multimedia support (images, audio).
-   Fully automated AI text synthesis.
-   Importing notes from external applications.
-   Real-time collaboration.
-   A public API.

## Project Status

**In Development**: This project is actively under development and is currently focused on delivering the core features defined in the MVP scope.
